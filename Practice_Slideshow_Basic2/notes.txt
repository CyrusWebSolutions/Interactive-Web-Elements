The order of the script elements in HTML is very important. Where the slideshow_data.js has arrays used in slideshow.js, the slideshow_data.js file needs to be first
in the head tag of HTML then follow with slideshow.js. This way the data file with the arrays is created and available for the slideshow.js file to use.
If you place them in the wrong order, for this example, the first image won't load on refresh and there will be no image or caption until a button is clicked.
This is due to the first script running and initializing currentSlide to an array that doesn't exist yet.
